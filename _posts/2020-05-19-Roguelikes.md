###### On dealing with loss, over and over again

I've played *a lot* of video games. Some single player games have solidified inside my head as masterpieces, like Nier Automata or Prey (2017). Some multiplayer games I jump back to every once in a while - no one ever truly quits OSRS, they just take extended breaks.

As is the case with many people, the quarantine period has given me a lot of time to clean out my games library. This was when I bumped into Nethack, a game I installed and played only once before giving up.

Why did I give up?

_95% of gamers use WASD in the first 5 seconds of a game. The other 5% press ESC for commands_

After - just like me - you let the game choose everything including your gender, race, alignment, etc..., during the first playthrough, you are instantly dropped into this beautiful ASCII 2x4 room with 2 doors, one of which I opened and walked through then got stuck down there. I'm the @, and my cat is Mr. f next to me.

At this point I decided to go back north and check out other paths, where I am greeted with another letter of the alphabet:

_'o' stands for goblin_

Nice way of saying "hi." This is where I used my 200iq brain to press '?' for a list of commands, where I am barraged with this:

_You have to toggle two-weapon combat?_

I called it quit then and there. Obviously this is an exaggeration of events because the actual first time I played this, my character died from being gangbanged by 3 kobolds instead.

### What makes a roguelike fun?

Why was I looking for roguelikes in the first place? I used to play Dead Cells - which I will argue is a [roguelite](https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelites/wiki/platformers), despite some descriptions saying it's a roguelike. The fundamental difference here is a sense of progression that's preserved after playthroughs (gold, unlocked weapons at start, etc...). Dead Cell's dungeons are procedurally-generated, but ultimately the gameplay wasn't varied enough for my liking *because* I felt stronger. Things weren't RANDOM enough!

Roguelike (or rogue-like) is a subgenre of role-playing video games characterized by a dungeon crawl through procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, and **permanent death** of the player character.

The phrase "permanent death" is certainly something I'm not used to seeing in a playthrough. If a character in a story-driven narrative is dead, the experience usually is diminished:

- For a game with multiple characters (e.g: Fire Emblem), 1 death means 1 fewer party member I can interact (have children) with.
- For a game with 1 protagonist (e.g: DOOM), permadeath means starting from scratch. Hours of killing demons are lost.

But roguelikes are truly RANDOM, one playthrough to the next if I wanted it to. I had to give them a shot right? Enter my search for a "fun" roguelike game. Let's not talk about Nethack, but others from 4chan's robust /rlg/ threads
